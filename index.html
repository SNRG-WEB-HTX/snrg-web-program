I pulled your SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1).html and reviewed it as-is. 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

Ratings (1–100)
Desktop: 93 / 100

What’s elite already

Brand system + typography scale is strong

Pricing cards + 2-col feature grid read premium

Motion feels intentional (not cheesy)

“Selected Projects” naming is on-point

What’s holding it back

Hero vertical padding still too generous (first fold feels “floaty”)

Final CTA logo → text gap is still looser than it should be (logo needs to “cap” the headline)

Mobile: 86 / 100

What’s strong

Hero is much more compressed than earlier versions

Pricing feature grid stays 2 columns (good)

Sticky CTA spacing is handled by footer padding (good)

What’s holding it back

You’re hiding the subtitle on mobile but you want it visible + tight under the divider (right now .section-subtitle{display:none;} kills it). 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

The divider (“Built Different…”) is too small vs hero headline on mobile and the divider block adds extra vertical air.

Still too much space under hero logo + under final CTA logo.

Direct Claude Instructions (tight, exact, no “interpretation”)

Paste this to Claude and tell it: “Do exactly this in this file.”

1) HERO: tighten space under logo + reduce overall hero padding (ALL DEVICES, stronger on mobile)
Desktop + mobile (global):

Reduce the hero top/bottom padding by ~15%

Reduce the gap between hero logo and hero text by pulling .hero-title upward slightly

Change these existing rules:

In .hero reduce the padding clamp range (it’s currently too tall). 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

In .hero-title reduce bottom margin (too much air before CTAs). 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

Mobile-only (inside @media(max-width:768px)):

Add/replace with:

@media(max-width:768px){
  .hero{
    padding:68px 0 14px; /* tighter than current 80/20 */
  }
  .hero-logo{
    max-width:200px;
  }
  .hero-content{
    margin-top:-28px; /* tighter than current -18 */
  }
  .hero-title{
    margin-top:6px;      /* pulls text closer to logo */
    margin-bottom:12px;  /* tighter CTA stack */
  }
}

2) PRICING: mobile divider must match hero heading size, and subtitle must appear UNDER it (centered, tight, no spill)
Current issue:

You hide the subtitle on mobile (.section-subtitle{display:none;}) 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)


But you want it visible and tight under the divider.

Do this (mobile only):

A) Make the divider headline match hero headline scale on mobile
B) Show the subtitle on mobile, but only inside pricing
C) Tighten spacing between pricing cards + divider

Add this inside @media(max-width:768px) AFTER the current mobile rules:

@media(max-width:768px){
  /* tighten the stack between card 1 -> divider -> card 2 */
  .pricing-grid{ gap:12px; }

  /* BIG divider (match hero headline size) */
  .pricing-mobile-divider{
    font-size:clamp(28px,7vw,44px); /* mirrors hero headline feel */
    margin:12px 0;                  /* was ~20–28 */
    padding:8px 0;                  /* was ~16–20 */
    line-height:1.05;
  }

  /* show pricing subtitle ONLY on mobile, centered + tight */
  .pricing .section-subtitle{
    display:block;
    margin:10px auto 0;
    max-width:34ch;
    line-height:1.35;
    font-size:15px;
    text-wrap:balance;
  }
}

Subtitle formatting (NO spill, clean)

Your English subtitle already has a <br> in the HTML. 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)


Keep it. The max-width:34ch + text-wrap:balance makes it look “elite” instead of ragged.

3) FINAL CTA “FOOTER LOGO” + TEXT: reduce logo by half and pull headline tight under it

Right now the final CTA uses .footer-logo and the gap is still too big. 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)

Do this (global):
.final-cta .footer-logo{
  max-width:clamp(90px,16vw,140px); /* ~50% reduction */
  margin:0 auto 4px;               /* tight under logo */
}
.final-cta h2{
  margin-top:0;
}

And tighten final CTA section padding:
.final-cta{
  padding:22px 0 30px; /* tighter overall */
}

4) “Footer” section: it currently has NO logo, only copyright

Your actual <footer> only contains the copyright line. 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)


So “footer logo” work is really hero logo + final CTA logo (the two logos on-page).

If you do want a logo above copyright in the footer, Claude should:

Add an <img class="footer-logo"> inside the <footer> container

Then apply the same “tight stack” rules as final CTA

5) Mobile: tighten spacing between pricing cards even more (your request)

You already reduced card padding to 14px. 

SNRG_ELITE_FINAL (1)


Do this too:

@media(max-width:768px){
  .pricing-card{ padding:12px; }
  .pricing-term{ margin-bottom:6px; }
  .pricing-features{ margin-bottom:8px; }
}

If Claude follows this exactly, your scores move to:

Desktop: 95 / 100

Mobile: 92–94 / 100 (the subtitle + divider fix is the big jump)

If you want, paste Claude’s output back here (or upload the revised HTML) and I’ll re-rate it again and call out what’s still leaking spacing.
